# Ocean system Figura avatar

- gaming
- ultra work in progress
- enjoy looking at bad code

## Developing (why?)

If you want to contribute, use the Python script for building. This will require installing Yuescript as well, preferably through Luarocks `luarocks install yuescript`. To make development as frictionless as possible, it is also recommended to symlink the build folder as an avatar into your Minecraft instance's Figura folder.
