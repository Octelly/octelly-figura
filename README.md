# Ocean system Figura avatar

- gaming
- ultra work in progress
- enjoy looking at bad code

## Developing

- install [Nix](https://nixos.org/)
- enter the dev environment using ``nix develop``
- build with ``python build.py``

> **Tip**: I recommend symlinking the build directory to Figura's avatar folder and setting up a "reload avatar" keybind for frictionless development.
